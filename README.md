Just a bored engineering graduate student who likes to have fun with math and science!

Occasionally I will make nerdy videos about anything and everything I feel like, you should check them out. Maybe some of them will even be funny[^1].

Oh, I also published a book, and I think it's pretty good[^3]. Check it out on Amazon!

I post all the source files for my videos *(including a write-up explaining the math[^2] and any written programs)*. If that sounds super ðŸ”¥**awesome**ðŸ¤¯ and ðŸ§ **interesting**ðŸ¤“ to you, look for the repository with the same name as the video!

[^1]: Citation needed.
[^2]: I'm an engineer, not a mathematician, so the rigor and elegance of my mathematical gymnastics might not be quite up to par :wink:.
[^3]: I'm slightly biased to this.
