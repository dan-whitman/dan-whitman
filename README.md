Just a bored engineering graduate student who likes to have fun with math and science!

Occasionally I will make nerdy videos about anything and everything I feel like, you should check them out. Maybe some of them will even be funny[^1].

I post all the source files for my videos *(including a write-up explaining the math[^2] and any written programs)*. If that sounds super ðŸ”¥**awesome**ðŸ¤¯ and ðŸ§ **interesting**ðŸ¤“ to you, look for the repository with the same name as the video!
